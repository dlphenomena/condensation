# Condensation Phenomenon

The condensation phenomenon in neural networks describes how, during the nonlinear training of neural networks, neurons in the same layer tend to condense into groups with similar outputs. 

The first figure illustrates the condensation phenomenon, where lines of the same color represent neurons possessing identical weights.

The second figure is the phase diagram for two-layer relu neural networks at infinite-width limit. The green region denotes the regime in which condensation occurs in the neural networks.
